		We initialize a Metric by instantiating the sequenceObjects.Metric class, which is the same module where we find things like
		sequenceObj, genomeObj and Translation defined. We always pass three arguments to the Metric constructor: <em>typeName</em>, <em>seqList</em>, and <em>specsList</em>.
		<!--These arguments should usually be gathered by a <strong>MetricWidget</strong> of some sort (this is a separate module which has more or less a picker which chooses the setup MetricWidget,
		which is subclassed sort of MetricWidget, but has some conserved behaviors when the "Go" button is impressed
		(not unlike the screenInWidget / superScreenInWidget combo in the NetSearchWidgets that import sequences from the internet, 
		where the parser must be individually selected but the import mechanics once some specification dict has been produced are relatively well conserved.
		-->
		To simplify GUI-driven MetricRoutine initiation (since we must expect that these routines can require computation times much larger than a GUI refresh period),
		all MetricRoutines are generally executed by a call to the MetricRoutines.runMetric() wrapper, which permits a generalized thread maintenance approach and some output standardization. However, if you want to call a MetricRoutine directly from an 
		Interpreter session, you are certainly permitted to. Each MetricRoutine accepts two arguments as input: a list of sequenceObjects, and a dictionary of metadata. The required metadata naturally varies depending on the routine.
		Output is always in the form of a dictionary, which generally includes generated data in the form of a NumPy array or file, and metadata. There is a unique PyQt widget associated with each MetricRoutine that is able to use the output dictionary to produce a graphic display:
		 linking each MetricRoutine method to its corresponding output QWidget subclass  is another task performed by the runMetric wrapper function.

				<h2>SummaryPlot</h2><br>
<p>SummaryPlot provides a means of displaying long-sequence information in a format that is independent of sequence length. It is designed to ameliorate many of the difficulties involved with trying to recognize patterns in long sequences of serial, small character-set data.
<br>
The Summary Plot breaks down a sequence into all of its constituent substrings, and displays their relative frequencies in two-dimensional form. The leftmost stack of colored rectangles represents the single-character composition of the sequence. For a character set of cardinality=4,
each of the four single-character rectangles will be further subdivided into the constituent length=2 substrings to which it gives rise. The pattern is then applied recursively for substrings up to the user-specified 'maxLength' in length.<br><br>  
We can demonstrate a SummaryPlot using the cryptochrome sequence downloaded in the sequenceObjects tutorial. Note that the 'specs' dict used to contain Metric parameters requires only a 'maxLength' entry, for simplest default operation:

<pre><code>
>>> import sequenceObjects as so
>>> crypFile=str(os.getcwd())+'/data/FASTAfiles/JQ713137.fasta'
>>> crypFile
Sequence initialization completed: 
JQ713137.1 Helicoverpa armigera cryptochrome CRY2-2 mRNA, complete cds.
, 2809 bp
>>> specs={'maxLength':3}
>>> sp=so.Metric('SummaryPlot', [cryp] , specs)
</code></pre>
The instantiation of Metric sp under these conditions will generate a live pyplot figure similar to that below. <br><br>
<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/cry_default.png" alt="figure" height="400"><br><br>
				
<p>Since the newly generated figure is still the plt.gcf(), we can still perform any pyplot updates on the figure using the interpreter...</p>
<pre><code>
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> plt.title('More Succinct Title')
&lt; matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x7f6e898fecd0&gt;
>>> 
</code></pre>

There are a host of optional parameters that can be specified for SummaryPlots, many pertaining to data display. Among the most important is 'recursive' mode. By default,
for each substring rectangle that will generate subrectangles (ie, if len(substring) &lt; maxLength), the constituent subrectangles are sorted by their frequency. The nonconserved color ordering enables simplified recognition of substring trends. 
However, it may also be desirable to generate the spatial color progression according to a regular sequence. In this case, information is gleaned from the spatial organization of the rectangles, rather than the explicit color pattern.    
<br>
We will demonstrate the difference below:
<br>
<pre><code>
>>> specsR={'maxLength':3, 'order':'recursive'}
>>> sp=so.Metric('SummaryPlot', [cryp] , specsR)
</code></pre>
<img style="border:1px solid black;" src="images/cry_recursive.png" alt="figure" height="400"><br><br>
<p> Other important options that can be specified include a spatial tranpose (<code>'transpose':'True</code>),
	a fractional-composition based y-axis display (<code>'pctMode':True</code>), and autogeneration of image files bypassing the pyplot session (<code>'gMode':'Headless', 'gFile'=$outfile</code>) </p>
